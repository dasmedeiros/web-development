                I help organizations make better decisions by translating raw information into tangible ideas. To achieve the best outcomes, I can employ a range of the most modern data-driven techniques and tools such as SQL, Python, Spark, Power BI, and Tableau.
                In 2021, after a successful and enriching internship in a global company and just before graduating I landed a job in the booming field of data science. I worked as a Business Intelligence Analyst solving problems for major financial institutes in Brazil. In a span of 15 months, I was able to lay the analytics foundations for 3 big players by helping them launch an AI in the form of chatbots which generated massive amounts of data. As the 'data guy' I was responsible for defining data tracking, data manipulation, and translating both structured and unstructured data it into actionable insights.
                <br>Now in 2022, I made an ambitious move to Canada to expand my knowledge in data science by taking a data analytics post-graduate program at Durham College. My willingness to change, working hard skills, and high motivation are making this the most life-changing experience.
                Do you need help with extracting useful insights from big data? Contact me and I will let you know how my hard skills along with my result orientation and hands-on competencies can help your organization achieve its key objectives.
